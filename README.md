Predicting onset of Diabetes in humans after training our model on pima Indian diabetes database.
In this program I have created a classfication artficial neural network using grid search and K fold cross validation.I have made seperate modules in which only k fold cross validation is carried out while in the other grid search with K-fold cross validation is also implemented. In this classification ANN grid search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for our classifier and dropout regularization is also used to prevent overfitting and improve performance of the classifier on test dataset.
I approached this problem from scratch and tried to experiment and find optimal ways of increasing accuracy and generalisation of the classifier so that it works well on new dataset. Hope this helps!
